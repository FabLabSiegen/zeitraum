# Adolph Diesterweg

Friedrich Adolph Wilhelm Diesterweg (1790-1866) was a school pedagogue born in Siegen. 

Diesterweg counted among the masterminds of progressive education and fought for “natural” education. His aim was “…to always nurture and educate people in their own right and for their own sake, according to the nature of their aptitude”.

As an education politician, he fought against the strong influence exerted by both politics and the church on the educational system. At the same time, Diesterweg was a great advocate of general compulsory education. In addition, he wanted to help provide teaching staff with better training and greater social recognition. 

In the run-up to the 1848 Revolution, Diesterweg was heavily criticized and subsequently suspended from his duties. He later worked as a publicist and politician before dying in Berlin on July 7th 1866. 

Diesterweg’s birthplace in Kölner Street was destroyed during the Second World War. A bust of the great pedagogue, created by the sculptor Friedrich Reusch, can however be seen in Graben Street, next to the University of Siegen’s Lower Castle Campus. The bust was unveiled in 1890 to commemorate Diesterweg’s 100th birthday.

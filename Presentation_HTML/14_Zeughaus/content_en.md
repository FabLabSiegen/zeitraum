Johann VII. the Middle (1561-1623) was one of the most eminent military historians and practitioners of his time. His work was widespread and his assistance sought by Protestants. As governor, Johann had the armoury built from irregular greywacke stones after 1607. An inventory from the early 17th century provides information on the quantity and variety of war equipment stored there. According to this inventory, the armoury in Siegen was an impressive arsenal of weapons and also contained some of the Count's own inventions. The building later accommodated part of Siegen Jesuit College. Later, the Prussian state sold the building to the Dresler family, who then gave it as a gift to the Evangelische Gesellenverein (Protestant Journeymenâ€™s Association) in 1888. The armoury is now privately owned.

<h1 id="hts-hüttentalstrasse-hüttental-urban-freeway">HTS – Hüttentalstrasse (Hüttental urban freeway)</h1>
<p>The Hüttentalstrasse, called HTS for short, is a federal highway that crosses the Siegen conurbation from north to south. The highway owes its name to the former town of Hüttental, which was incorporated into the city of Siegen in 1975 and whose area is contiguous to the HTS.</p>
<p>The HTS has had a significant Impact on the townscape of Siegen. Due to topographical circumstances, long stretches of the road had to be built on concrete stilts and as a result, it passes over the roofs of the city.</p>
<p>The project was controversial from the outset. Noise nuisance, costly construction work, high costs and, last but not least, the appearance of the HTS have repeatedly provoked public disagreement. Today, the population of Siegen has largely settled with HTS and for many people, it is now indispensable.</p>

# Johann VII. of Nassau-Siegen

Johann VII. of Nassau-Siegen (1561-1623), known as “The Middle”, was the Count of Nassau-Siegen. He received the partial county with its residence in Siegen as his inheritance portion when his father divided his estate in 1607. Johann VII. subsequently had the Lower Castle developed and fortified. In 1616, he also founded a military school in the newly-built arsenal before dying in Siegen in 1623.

Inheritance disputes with his son Johann VIII. the Younger, who had converted to Catholicism, resulted in Johann VII. issuing a testamental decree that the County of Nassau-Siegen should be divided into three parts.  Johann VII.’s final resting place can still be found today in the Royal Crypt at the Lower Castle. 

Hermann Kuhmichel designed a statue of the Count, which has stood next to the Hainpforte (Copse Portal) at the castle grounds since 2001. Originally intended to serve as a tribute to the Count’s importance as military commander, the large-scale sculpture had previously stood at the Heidenberg barracks. Moving the statue highlighted a different aspect of Johann’s life: having relocated Herborn College to Siegen, he earned recognition as the father of the university tradition.

# Castle Grounds

* First mentioned in the 17th century
* Area of 16,000 m² today
* Scene of numerous cultural events

The grounds of the Upper Castle have remained a popular destination right to the present day. In 1888, the 16,000-m² site was established as a public park used for recreation and cultural events. A visit to see the magnificent, ever-changing flowerage and the partially exotic tree stock is very rewarding and highly recommended. 

The design of the grounds has changed repeatedly over the years, according to the trends of the times. At the beginning of the 19th century, it is reported that the flower garden was partly laid out in terraces and surrounded by a wall. The city was allowed to use the park as a burial ground in 1840 but soon replaced it with the new cemetery on Lindenberg Hill.  

As of 1949, the Siegen Castle Games were held in the park. They played a significant role in promoting the popularity of the park following the destruction wrought by World War II.  These days, the popularity of the park is upheld by events such as the “Sunday Afternoons at 4”-concerts or the popular “Siegen Summer Festival”.

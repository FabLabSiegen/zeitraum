# Henner and Frieder

“Henner” (Harry) and “Frieder” (Fred) are two bronze statues that epitomise the history of iron ore mining and the iron and steel industry in Siegen and the surrounding area. The Siegen sculptor Friedrich Reusch (1843-1906) designed the larger-than-life figures of a miner and a steel smelter in 1902 for a large industrial and trade show held in Düsseldorf. 

When the exhibition ended, the figures were bequeathed as a gift to the city of Siegen and were first placed on Siegen Bridge in 1904. They have changed location many times since then. At present, they are located on the new bridge overlooking the redesigned banks of the river Sieg. 

The sculptor Friedrich Reusch had intended Henner and Frieder to pay tribute not only to the mining industry but also to the frugal and hard-working people of the Siegerland. However, their presence at the centre of the lower part of town for decades has meant that they have come to be a landmark of the city itself for many people.

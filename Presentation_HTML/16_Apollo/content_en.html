<ul>
<li>built as a cinema in 1935</li>
<li>new building erected in 2007 to house a theatre while maintaining the original facade</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apollo Theatre’s first repertory season began in August 2007. The civic theatre with its 521 seats, a stage depth of 15 m, a portal width of 14 m and 40 pulleys is a playhouse without a permanent ensemble. Even so, the theatre presents 2 - 3 in-house productions each year. The programme is a pot-pourri of theatrical performances, concerts and music theatre. One particular highlight is the Siegen Biennale, which has taken place since 2009. The Apollo-Theatre is managed by an association of sponsors and is located on the site of the former Apollo cinema. When the cinema complex was converted into today's theatre, only the façade of the movie theatre, built in 1935, remained. Behind the façade, a completely new building was erected.</p>

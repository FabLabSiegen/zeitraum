<h1 id="nikolaikirche-st.-nicholas-church-with-the-coronet-the-citys-landmark">Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas’ Church), with the “coronet”, the city’s landmark</h1>
<ul>
<li>Protestant parish church, originally dating from the 13th century</li>
</ul>
<p>The late Romanesque hall church with its unique hexagonal central building and its nave with three aisles was built in the 2nd quarter of the 13th century. Dedicated to Saint Nicholas, patron saint of travellers and merchants, it is a medieval town market church, surrounded by shops, booths and stalls. Since 1530, the parish church of the Counts of Nassau has been Protestant and since roughly 1580, it has been the main reformed parish church of the town of Siegen.</p>
<p>On his elevation to princely status, Johann Moritz of Nassau-Siegen had a large wrought-iron and gold-plated crown placed on the church’s tower. This “coronet”, known far and wide, soon became the city’s landmark. The church’s treasury is also home to an exceptional precious object: a gilded baptismal bowl donated by the Prince. It is made of Peruvian silverwork dating from the 16th century.</p>

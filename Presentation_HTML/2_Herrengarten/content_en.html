<ul>
<li>Park in 17th century</li>
<li>Site later developed</li>
<li>Current status: Plans to return Herrengarten to its earlier state of public park</li>
</ul>
<p>The Herrengarten (“Gentlemen’s Garden”) was originally situated just outside the city gates of Siegen proper. Johann Moritz von Nassau-Siegen (Prince John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen), (1604-1679), had it laid out as a pleasance, contained by a wall and wrought-iron railings. A portion of these historical railings, which are topped by spearheads, can still be seen today in the gardens of the Upper Castle. The site remained the only substantial green area in the lower town for a long time until it finally succumbed to development. Present plans propose transforming the area into a park once again.</p>

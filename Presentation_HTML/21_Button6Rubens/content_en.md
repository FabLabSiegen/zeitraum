# Peter Paul Rubens

Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) was a distinguished baroque painter and a diplomat of the Spanish Netherlands. He was very probably born in the street Burgstrasse, house number 10, close to the Upper Castle. What is known for certain is that his father was held under house arrest in Siegen, as he had been accused of having an extra-marital affair with Anna of Saxony, William of Orange’s spouse. The house thought to be Ruben’s birthplace was completely destroyed during the Second World War. In its place today is the “Realschule am Oberen Schloss” (“Upper Castle Secondary School”).

Peter Paul Rubens is an important regional memorial. Some of the Master’s works can be seen today in the Siegerland Museum at the Upper Castle, and it is in his honour that the Rubens Prize has been awarded every five years since 1957. 

The Rubens Well, situated in the Castle Grounds, stands testimony to the argument between the cities of Cologne, Antwerp and Siegen who all claimed to be the birthplace of the famous painter.

Siegen railway station was opened in January 1861 at the same time as the branch line that runs from Siegen to Betzdorf. Just a few months later, in August 1861, the Altena-Siegen segment of the Ruhr-Sieg-line was also opened. The rail connection was intended to enable the transport of coal from the Ruhr area quickly and cheaply to the Siegerland, where it was needed for smelting.

In 1882, the station was supplemented by a circular locomotive shed. Railway vehicles requiring maintenance or repair work could be moved in and out via a turntable. Today the "Südwestfälische Eisenbahnmuseum" (the South Westphalian Railway Museum) is located in this shed.

From 1942 to 1944, Siegen station was used to deport Jews to concentration camps. The railway station was badly damaged by Allied bombing raids from December 1944 to March 1945.

At the moment, the station and track systems are being extensively modernised. The measures are due to be completed in 2017.

<p>From the Middle Ages onward, Siegen was surrounded by a city wall. The wall, which was built in the course of the 13th century, had 18 towers by the middle of the 16th century. These towers were added to the wall at regular intervals. Anyone wanting to enter or leave the centre of town had to pass through one of three main gates: Wetzlar Gate (later known as Löhrtor, Tanner’s Gate), Marburg Gate or Kölner Gate (Cologne Gate). In addition, there was a number of smaller portals: Heilige Pforte (Holy Portal), Eselspforte (Donkey Portal) or Hainpforte (Copse Portal). Old engravings show where the old city wall and its arrow slits used to be. Although the city wall and all the gates were demolished in the 19th century, substantial portions of the old city fortifications can still be seen until the present day.</p>

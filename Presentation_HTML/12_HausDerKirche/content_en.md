The District Church Office is situated in what used to be the inner ward of the Upper Castle. When Johann VIII. of Nassau-Siegen took over the administration of the whole county in 1623, he left the building to the Jesuit Order. The newly established college was gradually but repeatedly modified and extended. In 1901, ownership of the property was transferred to the Educational Society of the Synod of Siegen and District. An orphanage was built and named “Johann Moritz Foundation”. Further alterations and extensions followed. The Home of the Church is presently the seat of the superintendency and the entire administrative body of the church districts of Siegen and Wittgenstein. It also houses telephone counselling services as well as the Adult, Family and Life Counselling Centre of the church district.

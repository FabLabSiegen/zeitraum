<ul>
<li>The seat of the Protestant line of Nassau-Siegen as of 1623</li>
<li>1669 Building of the Royal Crypt</li>
<li>1695 Reconstruction of the Lower Castle following a town fire</li>

</ul>
<p>The site of the present day Lower Castle was the location of a Franciscan monastery in the 15th and 16th centuries. As of 1623, the former monastery became the seat of the reformed line of the House Nassau-Siegen. The residence was gradually extended and became known as the “Nassauischer Hof” (Court of Nassau).</p>
<p>Having fallen victim to a town fire in 1695, the Court was replaced by a palace boasting three wings. Construction began on the angular Wittgenstein wing in 1717. This building flanks the spacious palace courtyard together with the central wing (housing unit) and the Kurlandian wing, including the “Fat Tower”. Built in 1669 by the Dutch architect Maurits Post, the royal burial vault can be found behind the central archway of the central wing. Dependants of the royal dynasty of Nassau-Siegen resided in the palace until the buildings passed into state ownership in 1781. The building has been home to the University of Siegen’s Faculty of Economics, Information Systems and Economic Law since 2015.</p>

Sankt Marienkirche (St. Mary’s Church) is the only Catholic church within the former city walls. Furthermore, it was the first Catholic parish church to be built in Siegen after the Reformation. The Jesuit Order laid the foundation stone in 1702 but it was not until 23 years later, in 1725, that the building could be assigned to its purpose. The princely stalls were once situated in the choir of St. Mary’s church, along with the crowning coat of arms of the alliance that can now be seen above the door in this room of the museum.  Siegen’s only sacral structure from the late Baroque era was destroyed during the bombing raid in 1944. It was rebuilt in 1948 and has subsequently been renovated several times.

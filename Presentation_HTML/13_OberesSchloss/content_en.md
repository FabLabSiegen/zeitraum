The castle on Siegberg Hill is first mentioned in documents dating from 1259. For 200 years, the property was divided between the former rulers – the Archbishop of Cologne and the Counts of Nassau. This double rule ended in 1421 with the Counts of the Nassau-Siegen line having exclusive reign over the castle and the town of Siegen. With the construction of the Lower Castle at the beginning of the 18th century, the Upper Castle was designated the ancestral seat of the Line of Nassau-Siegen. 

Over the course of time, the Upper Castle has experienced a variety of uses and conversions. Siegen and its surrounding area (the Siegerland) was transferred to Prussian ownership in the early 19th century. By this time, the Line of Nassau-Siegen had already died out. In 1888, Siegen municipality bought the Upper Castle and decided to establish the “Regional Museum of Siegen” in 1903. This was duly opened in the Upper Castle in 1905.

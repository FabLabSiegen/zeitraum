# University of Siegen
# old municipal hospital

* 1703-1862/63 urban hospice
* 1865 city hospital
* Seat of Siegen University’s “Ludwig Wittgenstein” Building since 2015 

The city hospital, built in 1865, was the academic teaching hospital of the University of Marburg and had a capacity of 220 beds with four specialist departments. It was municipalised 125 years ago and merged with Siegen District Hospital at the Hüttental site in 2013. The building in Kohlbett Street was sold and renamed Ludwig-Wittgenstein Building after one of the most significant philosophers of the 20th century. It has been home to Siegen University’s Faculty III (Economics, Information Systems and Business Law) since 2015.  

Immediately next door to Ludwig-Wittgenstein Building is the South Westphalian Active Museum, located in the hospital’s former air-raid bunker.

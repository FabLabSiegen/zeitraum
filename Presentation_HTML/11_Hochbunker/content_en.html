<p>Even before the Second World War began, the Lord Mayor of Siegen, Alfred Fissmer, had tunnels and bunkers built as protection in case of air raids. He had his reasons for this: Siegen was a garrison town and an important centre of wartime industry.</p>
<p>The Allies’ first large air raid on Siegen took place on December 16th 1944. 348 people lost their lives. These included 32 foreign prisoners, condemned to hard labour in Germany and billeted in Siegen. 80% of Siegen’s old town centre was destroyed.</p>
<p>More or less at the same time as this air raid was taking place, a German V2 missile hit the Belgian city of Antwerp. This attack, which killed 561 people, had been commanded from Siegen.</p>
<p>The bombing of Siegen is firmly anchored in the collective memory of the population. Since 2009, the victims of Siegen and Antwerp have been remembered together.</p>

<h1 id="historic-town-hall-and-market">Historic Town Hall and Market</h1>
<ul>
<li>First mentioned in 1303 as a large store, council hall and jail</li>
<li>Several conversions and extensions</li>
<li>1948-1957 new construction of the present-day building</li>
</ul>
<p>The origins of the town hall on the market place can be traced back to the founding of the city in 1224. However, it was not until 1303 that a “department store” was first mentioned in documents which detailed stalls for traders and craftsmen as well as administrative offices. The building was also used as a prison, courtroom, armoury and ceremonial hall/ballroom. Several conversions and extensions took place over the years as the building was adapted to accommodate changes in administrative affairs. After World War II, the building was reconstructed and extended. The market place was given a new design in 1999/2000 and now has room to host various events.</p>
<p>In addition to the historic town hall, the municipal administration of Siegen has other sites in the districts of Weidenau and Geisweid.</p>

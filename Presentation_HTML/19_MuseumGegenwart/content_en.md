* Museum for Contemporary Art since 2001

The Museum of Contemporary Art, located near the Lower Castle, opened in 2001. The well-known architect Josef Paul Kleihues expanded the old telegraph office, built in 1894, with a new building and so created a prestigious site for art. 

The museum houses exhibitions of contemporary art and works from its own collections:  the renowned Lambrecht-Schadeberg collection of paintings includes important works by the world-famous Rubens laureates of the city of Siegen. The collection of contemporary art, which was established in 1960, is partly comprised of selected works of photography, video and installation art. The principal works include, for instance, the precise documentary photographs of half-timbered houses in the Siegerland, taken in black-and-white by Bernd and Hilla Becher.

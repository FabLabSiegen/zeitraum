<h1 id="walter-krämer">Walter Krämer</h1>
<ul>
<li>Herrmann Walter Krämer (1892 - 1941), born in Siegen, was a politician and a resistance fighter against National Socialism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to this membership in the German Communist Party (KPD), the Nazi regime took Krämer into preventive custody in 1933. Four years later, in 1937, he was incarcerated in Buchenwald concentration camp. Whilst there, he secretly acquired medical knowledge and skills. As the responsible functionary prisoner, he ran the camp infirmary and was instrumental in saving the lives of many concentration camp inmates. Walter Krämer was later removed to a satellite camp in Goslar-Hahndorf where he was shot by the SS on November 6th 1941.</p>
<p>While the Yad Vashem Remembrance Centre in Israel awarded Walter Krämer the title “Righteous Among Nations” in 2000, Siegen still continued to dispute his honour for a very long time. “The Doctor of Buchenwald” was finally commemorated in 2014 when “Walter Krämer Square” was opened at the district hospital in Siegen-Weidenau, complete with a sculpture comprised of concrete shafts and a bronze statue by the artist Erwin Wortelkamp.</p>

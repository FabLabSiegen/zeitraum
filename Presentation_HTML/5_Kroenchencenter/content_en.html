<ul>
<li>1899 Plaut and Daniel department store, Tietz department store as of 1928</li>
<li>1933 &quot;Aryanisation&quot;, renamed as Kaufhof</li>
<li>Present day location of the municipal library, adult education centre and the municipal archives of the city of Siegen</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1989, the businessmen Plaut and Daniel opened a department store in one of the houses on Market Street. In 1920, they decided to build a new, prestigious store, but went bankrupt in 1927.</p>
<p>The German-Jewish entrepreneur Alfred Leonhard Tietz took over the half-finished construction and had it completed. The first of its kind in Siegen, Tietz department store opened in 1928. In 1933, under the rule of the national socialists, all Jewish businesses were “Aryanised”. Tietz was forced to resign and leave the country. Tietz AG became “Westdeutscher Kaufhof AG”.</p>
<p>The store’s facade was destroyed during the bombing raid on the city on December 16th 1944. Redevelopment took place after the war and by 1952, the sales area had been restored to its pre-war standard.</p>
<p>In 1992, Kaufhof in Siegen’s upper town closed its doors for the last time. Despite the millions invested by the Kerber group in conversion and modernisation, the closure of the long-standing store could not be prevented. Siegen municipality took over the building in 1999 to develop it into a centre for art and culture. Today, the traditional department store is the seat of the municipal library, an adult education centre and the municipal archives of the city of Siegen.</p>
